"""You are given an array of points in the X-Y plane points where points[i] = [xi, yi].

Return the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the X and Y axes. If there is not any such rectangle, return 0.

 

Example 1:


Input: points = [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[2,2]]
Output: 4
Example 2:


Input: points = [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[4,1],[4,3]]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

1 <= points.length <= 500
points[i].length == 2
0 <= xi, yi <= 4 * 104
All the given points are unique."""
